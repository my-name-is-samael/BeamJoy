## How To

### How to install

- Install your BeamMP server ([BeamMP Server Download](https://beammp.com)) and configure it (at least your *AuthKey*).
- Launch your server once to initialize files.
- Download the last version of the mod ([Mod Releases](https://github.com/my-name-is-samael/BeamJoy/releases)).
- Unzip the mod archive in your server's *Resources* folder.
- Connect your game to your server.
- Type in the server console `bj setgroup <your_playername> owner` to gain permissions

(*your_playername* is not case-sensitive and can be a subpart of your actual playername).

### How to add a modded map to your server

- Ensure to have the permission *SetMaps*.
- Place the map archive in your server's *Resources* folder (not in *Client* or *Server* folders).
- In-game, navigate to *Config* Menu > *Server* > *Maps Labels*.
- At the bottom, fill in the *Tech Name* (name of the folder inside the archive), the *Map Label* (the label you want players to see) and the *Archive Full Name* (including the extension), e.g., "ks_spa", "SPA Francorchamps", "ks_spa_v20230929.zip".
- Click the green *Save* button.
- Your map will now appear in the map switcher and map vote areas.

The optimized map switcher only sends the current modded map to joining players, not all idle map mods.

**Caution** : When switching to or from a modded map, the server will restart. Ensure you have an active reboot system for your server.

### How to install basegame maps data

- Download the data archive ([available here](https://github.com/my-name-is-samael/BeamJoy/releases/tag/datapack-2024-12-20)).
- Extract it to the *Resources/Server/BeamJoyData/db/scenarii/* folder.
- Restart the server.
- All basegame maps, scenarios, and facilities will now be available for players.

### How to set or add a language to your server

The mod is packed with EN, FR, DE, IT, ES, PT and RU languages.

To remove languages:
- Go to the folder *Resources/Server/BeamJoyCore/lang* and delete the files you dont want.
- Update the *Resources/Server/BeamJoyData/db/bjc.json* file to remove any instances of those languages in:
    - Server.Lang
    - Server.Broadcasts
    - Server.WelcomeMessage

To add new language:
- You want to add an in-game language:
- - In the BeamNG main menu, open the console and type `dump(Lua:getSelectedLanguage())`.
- - You should get a result like *"en_EN"*. Name your future JSON file using the part before the underscore, converted to lowercase (e.g., *"Tr_UI"* becomes *tr.json*).
- Or you want to add a new language:
- - Find the best code for your language (usually 2 or 3 letters). Name your future JSON file with your lowered code (e.g., *tr.json*)
- Copy *Resources/Server/BeamJoyCore/lang/en.json* and rename it with the new name from the previous step.
- Translate the newly created file, but only change the values, not the keys, and do not modify variables between braces (**{** and **}**) in values.

To update labels:
- Find your language file in *Resources/Server/BeamJoyCore/lang*.
- As mentioned earlier, do not change keys or variables between braces (**{** and **}**) in values.

## FAQ

### I cannot spawn a vehicle even after setting myself the server owner. What did I do wrong ?
You should check your `MaxVehicles` inside `ServerConfig.toml` (beammp server root folder), the value cannot be set to `-1` (I recommand you to set it between 50 and 500).

### I cannot respawn my vehicle, it this broken ?
Scenarios have their own rules, here is the complete respawns guide by scenario :
  - `Freeroam` : All respawn are allowed by default. If staff member(s) configured respawn delay and/or teleport delay, you will have a countdown (visible in the header of the main beamjoy window) before you can do it again.
  - `Races (solo/multi)` : the allowed respawns mode is defined by the player who launched the race. There are multiple mode:
    - All respawns : __RecoverVehicle__ and __RecoverVehicleAlt__ are the only respawns allowed because they are fast and in-place. Other respawns are teleporting or reloading game physic (provokes a stutter).
    - No respawns : self explanatory
    - Last checkpoint / Stand : only the __LoadHome__ respawn wil be enabled and will bring you back to the last checkpoint/stand (the home is automatically defined by the scenario).
  - `Delivery (solo, package/vehicle)` : only the __RecoverVehicle__ respawn is enabled, but will bring you to Freeroam if you use it.
  - `DeliveryTogether` : As the other delivery modes, the __RecoverVehicle__ respawn is allowed, but this time it does not bring you back to Freeroam mode, instead it will cancel your next delivery reward (you should get to a garage or driving more carefully to keep it).
  - `Hunter` : The hunted player cannot respawn (its skills are valued in this mode). Hunters can use the __RecoverVehicle__ respawn but will then have a freeze countdown before they can drive again.
  - `Destruction Derby` : Participants have lives, and until they have, thay can use the __LoadHome__ respawn (note that if they still have live(s) and the takedown countdown reached 0, they will automatically get respawned).
  - `Speed` : In this mode, participants cannot respawn, since the mode goal is to stay over a speed limit and to become the last player alive.

For reference, here is the BeamJoy handled respawns list with default bindings:
- __RecoverVehicle__ : Keyboard `Insert` by default | Controller `Dpad left` by default
- __RecoverVehicleAlt__ : Keyboard `Ctrl + Insert` by default | not assigned by default on Controller
- __LoadHome__ : Keyboard `Home` by default | not assigned by default on Controller

If you are mainly `playing with a controller`, I suggest you to remove all respawn bindings and then to assign:
- __Recover Vehicle__ : `DPad left`
- __Save Home__ : `DPad left`
- __Load Home__ : `DPad Right`

### My game crashes during the join process or randomly with the following error

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc667d0e-45e4-4ee4-ac9e-ec9c7d364c84)

Unfortunately, I have no exact solution for now, since I never did experience this myself. Some users fixed it by removing their BeamNG version folder in LocalAppData (`%localappdata%\BeamNG.drive\->your_version<-`). If you still experience this issue, please see and join [this ticket.](https://github.com/my-name-is-samael/BeamJoy/issues/100).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Fork with only race features
- [ ] Toggleable automatic random weather presets (maybe with smooth transitions, waiting for base game changes for temperature and weather)
- [ ] Client-side cache system (cookie-like; useful for personal records in races, for example).

Implementing BeamMP v3.5+ features when it will come out:
- Add Core configs for AllowGuests ([#335](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/pull/335))
- Player limit join bypass by staff ([#372](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/pull/372))

## Credits

Thanks to all BETA testers who helped me test and debug the features:
dvergar, Trina, Baliverne0, Rodjiii, Lotax, Nath_YT, korrigan_91, and countless others.

A huge thanks to prestonelam2003 for his work on [CobaltEssentials](https://github.com/prestonelam2003/CobaltEssentials) which inspired me to create BeamJoy, although I didn't copy any lines of his code.

Another huge thank to StanleyDudek for his work on [CobaltEssentialsInterface](https://github.com/StanleyDudek/CobaltEssentialsInterface) which taught me how to create front-end BeamMP mods, communicate with the server, and the basic use of imgui.
