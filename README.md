## How To
<img src="/assets/banner-howto.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="How To" />

### How to install

- Install your BeamMP server ([BeamMP Server Download](https://beammp.com)) and configure it (at least your *AuthKey*).
- Launch your server once to initialize files.
- Download the last version of the mod ([Mod Releases](https://github.com/my-name-is-samael/BeamJoy/releases)).
- Unzip the mod archive in your server's *Resources* folder.
- Connect your game to your server.
- Type in the server console `bj setgroup <your_playername> owner` to gain permissions

(*your_playername* is not case-sensitive and can be a subpart of your actual playername).

### How to add a modded map to your server

- Ensure to have the permission *SetMaps*.
- Place the map archive in your server's *Resources* folder (not in *Client* or *Server* folders).
- In-game, navigate to *Config* Menu > *Server* > *Maps Labels*.
- At the bottom, fill in the *Tech Name* (name of the folder inside the archive), the *Map Label* (the label you want players to see) and the *Archive Full Name* (including the extension), e.g., "ks_spa", "SPA Francorchamps", "ks_spa_v20230929.zip".
- Click the green *Save* button.
- Your map will now appear in the map switcher and map vote areas.

The optimized map switcher only sends the current modded map to joining players, not all idle map mods.

**Caution** : When switching to or from a modded map, the server will restart. Ensure you have an active reboot system for your server.

### How to install basegame maps data

- Download the data archive ([available here](https://github.com/my-name-is-samael/BeamJoy/releases/tag/datapack-2024-12-20)).
- Extract it to the *Resources/Server/BeamJoyData/db/scenarii/* folder.
- Restart the server.
- All basegame maps, scenarios, and facilities will now be available for players.

### How to set or add a language to your server

The mod is packed with EN, FR, DE, IT, ES, PT and RU languages.

To remove languages:
- Go to the folder *Resources/Server/BeamJoyCore/lang* and delete the files you dont want.
- Update the *Resources/Server/BeamJoyData/db/bjc.json* file to remove any instances of those languages in:
    - Server.Lang
    - Server.Broadcasts
    - Server.WelcomeMessage

To add new language:
- You want to add an in-game language:
- - In the BeamNG main menu, open the console and type `dump(Lua:getSelectedLanguage())`.
- - You should get a result like *"en_EN"*. Name your future JSON file using the part before the underscore, converted to lowercase (e.g., *"Tr_UI"* becomes *tr.json*).
- Or you want to add a new language:
- - Find the best code for your language (usually 2 or 3 letters). Name your future JSON file with your lowered code (e.g., *tr.json*)
- Copy *Resources/Server/BeamJoyCore/lang/en.json* and rename it with the new name from the previous step.
- Translate the newly created file, but only change the values, not the keys, and do not modify variables between braces (**{** and **}**) in values.

To update labels:
- Find your language file in *Resources/Server/BeamJoyCore/lang*.
- As mentioned earlier, do not change keys or variables between braces (**{** and **}**) in values.

## FAQ
<img src="/assets/banner-faq.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="FAQ" />

### I cannot spawn a vehicle even after setting myself the server owner. What did I do wrong ?
You should check your `MaxVehicles` inside `ServerConfig.toml` (beammp server root folder), the value cannot be set to `-1` (I recommand you to set it between 50 and 500).

### I cannot respawn my vehicle, is this broken?
Each scenario has its own rules, and there are many different types of respawns, which we can group into three categories:
- **On-the-spot respawns:**
  - `Recover vehicle` (`Insert` / `DPad left` by default)
  - `Recover vehicle Alt` (`Ctrl+Insert` by default)
  - `Set Home` (`Ctrl+Home` by default)
- **Teleported respawns:**
  - `Recover to last road`
  - `Reset physics` (`R` / `DPad right` by default)
  - `Load Home` (`Home` by default)
  - `Reload vehicle` (`Shift+R` by default)
- **Others:**
  - `Reset all physics` (`Ctrl+R` by default)
  - `Reload all vehicles` (`Ctrl+Shift+R` by default)
  - `Drop player at camera` (`F7` by default)
  - `Drop player at camera no reset` (`Ctrl+F7` by default)

_Let’s not forget about `rewind`, available on `Recover vehicle` and `Recover vehicle Alt`._

Here’s how respawns behave depending on the scenario:
- **Freeroam**: All respawns are allowed. If the server is configured with a respawn and/or teleport delay, you’ll see a countdown in the main window before you can use it again.
- **Races (solo/multi)**: The available respawns are defined by the player who starts the race:
  - `All respawns`: All on-the-spot respawns will repair your vehicle in place, and teleported ones will bring you back to the last checkpoint. Rewind is enabled.
  - `No respawns`: Self-explanatory.
  - `Last checkpoint`: Both on-the-spot and teleported respawns will bring you back to the last checkpoint you passed. Rewind is disabled.
  - `Stand`: Both on-the-spot and teleported respawns will bring you back to the closest pit stand behind you, or to your starting position if none yet. Rewind is disabled.
- **Delivery (solo, package/vehicle)**: All respawns are disabled to keep the scenario fair (you’ll need to reach a garage to repair your vehicle, except for vehicle delivery).
- **DeliveryTogether**: Unlike the above, both on-the-spot and teleported respawns are available but will only repair you in place and will cancel your streak and reward. Rewind is limited to 5 seconds.
- **TagDuo**: Participants can use all respawns, but they will be repaired in place. Rewind is limited to 5 seconds.
- **Hunter**: The fugitive can only respawn if no hunter is nearby (distance is configurable), and hunters can respawn anytime but will be frozen for a few seconds to prevent abuse (also configurable). In both cases, respawns will only repair the vehicle in place. Rewind is limited to 5 seconds.
- **Infected**: All players can use both on-the-spot and teleported respawns, but they will be repaired in place. Rewind is limited to 5 seconds.
- **Destruction Derby**: Participants have lives, and as long as they have any left, they can use on-the-spot and teleported respawns, but they will be brought back to their starting point. (Note: if they have at least one life left and the countdown reaches zero, respawn will be triggered automatically.)
- **Speed**: In this mode, participants cannot respawn, since the goal is to stay above a certain speed limit and be the last player alive.

### Why some players can spawn traffic and some don't ? How can I spawn traffic during a scenario ?

Traffic spawning is dependant on group permissions. Players in groups having a `VehicleCap` attribute set to `-1` (_Infinite_) will automatically have access to traffic toggling, but not anytime.

Here the scenarii list players can toggle traffic in:
- Freeroam
- Vehicle Delivery
- Package Delivery
- Delivery Together
- Bus Mission

### Can I enable GPS path in races ?

The GPS route system is fully integrated into the base game, but unfortunately, it fails in one-way roads, prohibited directions, and off-road sections. This often makes the route guidance useless in many parts of a race.

If your race layout isn't intuitive, the best approach is to improve your level design. Keep in mind that at each checkpoint, racers should be able to see the next one (checkpoints are visible high in the sky when there are no buildings obstructing the view). Also, avoid placing checkpoints too far apart in classic races.

### Can I completely disable the "ghost mode" when somebody respawns ?

This is a respawn protection system enabled by default on your server, but you can configure it under `Edit` > `Freeroam Settings` (`Collisions Mode` field).

### Shadows are disappearing when I drive fast. What's going on ?

Strangely, this behavior is linked to the shadow distance setting (`Config` > `Environment` > `Sun` tab > `Shadow Distance` slider).<br/>
If you want to calibrate this setting correctly on your server, I recommend the following steps:
- Choose a fast vehicle configuration (e.g., the vanilla `Civetta Bolide Top Speed`).
- Find a location where you can reach maximum speed.
- Switch to the driver’s first-person camera.
- Increase your field of view to the maximum (holding `Num 3` by default).
- Check whether the shadow distance value works well under these conditions.

## Known issues
<img src="/assets/banner-knownissues.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Known Issues" />

- Windows system costs performances, this is a fact and it is unfortunate. But this is the only way BeamJoy have to not be intrusive (we do not want to force players by manually adding UI-Apps, but still give them mandatory scenario and server informations).
- When leaving a server with BeamJoy on, then going to freeroam or a non-BeamJoy server, the game will softlock during the loading screen. This is a module dependency issue and we don't have a solution for now, except than a complete remake of the mod ([Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/BeamJoy) versions are remakes and will fix this).
